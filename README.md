Thankful-e is an app built with RoR. It's an experiment to mashup Reddit and Craigslist's 'Missed Connections' for gratitude in the COVID era. 

# WHAT IS IT?

When most people hear about this project they ask: "Why do we need this when we already have Reddit/Facebook/whatever social media site?" Two reasons:

* First, one nice side effect when other people express gratitude is that it's often in the form of a heartwarming story that make us feel a little better about humanity as a whole. I don't know about you, but these days when I visit one of the major social media sites it doesn't make me feel any better about the world, sometimes the opposite. With that in mind, this is meant to be a happy little corner of the internet where you can read about the incredible things other folks are doing to help each other.

* Second, giving thanks actually has great benefits for the giver! I once heard a radio interview with a secular guy who wrote a book about spending a year trying to live by the rules of the bible. One of the big side effects for him was a newfound respect for expressing gratitude, he later gave a TED talk about it which you can [find here] (https://www.ted.com/talks/a_j_jacobs_my_journey_to_thank_all_the_people_responsible_for_my_morning_coffee?language=en). Intentionality is a bit of a buzzword these days and there's a lot to be skeptical of, but one thing that strikes home for me is that if you deliberately put tools in your life that are built to do something you'd like to do more often, you may actually change your own behavior. 

With all that in mind, the hope is that Thankful-e can be a tool help us all get through this tough moment.
